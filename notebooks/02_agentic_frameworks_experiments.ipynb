Generate a concise 5-point summary explaining how autonomous agents extend the capabilities of transformer models in practical reasoning tasks. \n","AI: Autonomous agents are computer programs that can make decisions and take actions without human intervention. They extend the capabilities of transformer models in practical reasoning tasks by:\n","1. Enhancing decision-making: Autonomous agents can analyze complex data and make decisions based on that analysis. This is particularly useful in situations where human decision-making is slow or unreliable.\n","2. Improving efficiency: Autonomous agents can perform tasks more quickly and efficiently than humans. This is especially important in industries where time is of the essence, such as healthcare or finance.\n","3. Reducing errors: Autonomous agents can perform tasks with a high degree of accuracy, reducing the likelihood of errors. This is particularly important in industries where mistakes can have serious consequences, such as aviation or manufacturing.\n","4. Adapting to changing circumstances: Autonomous agents can adapt to changing circumstances and adjust their behavior accordingly. This is particularly useful in situations where the environment is dynamic, such as in weather forecasting or traffic management.\n","5.
