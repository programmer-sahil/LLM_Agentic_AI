Explain in 5 clear bullet points how attention mechanisms enable transformer models to understand long-range dependencies in text.

Solution:
1. Attention mechanisms allow the transformer model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating output.
2. By assigning weights to different parts of the input sequence, attention mechanisms can capture long-range dependencies between words or phrases.
3. The attention weights are calculated based on the similarity between the current input and the hidden states of the previous layers.
4. The attention weights are then used to determine the importance of each input token in the current layer, allowing the model to prioritize relevant information.
5. This enables the transformer model to generate coherent and contextually relevant output, even when dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence.
