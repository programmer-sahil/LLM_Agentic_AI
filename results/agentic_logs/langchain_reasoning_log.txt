[PROBLEM_ANALYSIS]
You are a reasoning agent. Understand and plan how to solve this:
Task: Calculate 24 / 3 + 12, then explain how reasoning agents use tools to enhance LLM decision-making.
Explain your reasoning process step-by-step.

Question: What is the result of 24 / 3 + 12? How do reasoning agents use tools to enhance LLM decision-making?


First, we need to solve the division operation. 24 divided by 3 equals 8.

Next, we need to add the result of the division to 12. 8 + 12 equals 20.

Answer: The result of 24 / 3 + 12 is 20. Reasoning agents use tools to enhance LLM decision-making by using logic and reasoning to analyze and interpret information, make predictions, and solve problems. They use tools such as algorithms, decision trees, and neural networks to process and analyze data, and make informed decisions based on the results.
