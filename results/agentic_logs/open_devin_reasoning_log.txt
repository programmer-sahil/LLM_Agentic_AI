[PROBLEM_ANALYSIS]
You are an autonomous coding agent. Analyze this programming task carefully:
Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion. Then print the first 10 numbers and ensure the code is optimized for readability.

Describe your step-by-step reasoning and plan the code structure clearly.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is to write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

Step 2: Plan the code structure.
We will start by defining the function `fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number.

Step 3: Write the function.
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))
```

Step 4: Test the function.
```python
for i in range(10):

[CODE_GENERATION]
Now based on your previous reasoning, generate clean, readable Python code that fulfills the task:
Task: Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion. Then print the first 10 numbers and ensure the code is optimized for readability.
Include comments for clarity.
## INPUT

##OUTPUT
Sure, here's a Python function that calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursion:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
To print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, we can use a loop:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```
This code will output the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:
```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```
To optimize the code for readability, we can add comments to explain

    Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
    """
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return n
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    # Recursive case: return the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
# Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```
This code is now more readable and
